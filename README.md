# CSV Table Schema

CSV Table Schema is a pragmatic approach for defining [CSV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180) schemas. CSV Table Schema provides a CSV schema description via JSON.

Main features:

+ Easy schema definiton via JSON which can be validated against the [CSV Table Meta Schema](https://github.com/openpotato/csv-table-schema/blob/main/spec/csv-table-schema.json).
+ Dedicated to the CSV format.
+ Supports the following data types: string, enum, enum-set, bool, int, float, date, time, date-time, json and xml.
+ Supports CSV tables with ordered and unordered columns.
+ Supports CSV tables with or without header row.
+ Supports CSV dictionaries with key/value rows.
